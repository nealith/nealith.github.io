Extreme Road is a game I made for the first Houdini Game Jam, it was an opportunity to use Houdini and estimate if this software could have a potential for my projects. And it has.

This game jam didn't go the way I wanted it. My first idea was to create a city, based on Open Street Map to create a kind of Driver game, where you would have to transport shipment and run away of the police. But the procedural generation didn't go well. I had plenty of buildings where some floors were missing and corners also.

So, I decided to work a travel game where you drive a truck along a dangerous thin road. I tried to create this road in a procedural way, but without success.

Finally, I worked on river generation, that gave me an interesting result.
