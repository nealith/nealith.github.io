# Introduction

![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM4MTk3ODQucG5n/original/P1c2J2.png)

Project D (temporary name) is a long term project I had in mind for few years. I always was a huge fan of racing game, especially Need For Speed license. Watching Initial D and Wangan Midnight made me want to create a game that would take place in japanise street racing culture.

# Current status and future

For now this project is really at it's beginning, working mainly on the car behavior to give a good experience of racing and drifting to the player. But I would like to create a story driven game with features like multiple choice dialog that could affect the way opponents drive against you. I would like to explore things like simulating a mental stress on my AI when the player put pression during the race, skill three that could affect tunning of the car, or cost of the part, or give special ability like slowing down the time.

Currently, I am working on adding a drift assistance like on a lot of game, making the player experience easier, especially when you don't have sim racing installation (wheel, pedal, stick shift) or a gamepad.
