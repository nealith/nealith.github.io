I'm now living in France, focusing on these things:

- looking for a position abroad in the video game industry
- learning photography
- thinking and working on a video game project inspired from [Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_2033_(video_game)) serie and the world of [Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film))
