I'm now living in France, focusing on these things:

- looking for a position in the video game industry
- working on [ProjectD](/projectd), especially on the car behavior when drifting
- working on a [plugin](https://github.com/nealith/ScreenShotSceneCapture) for Unreal Engine, giving tools for screenshotting with low framerate loss
- learning photography, drawing, music et languages
- thinking and writing about differents projets, such a tool for self-tracking or a virtual synth to use with my [MiniLab Mk II](https://www.arturia.com/minilab-mkii)
